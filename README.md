As cyberattacks evolve, traditional honeypots often generate massive volumes of noisy log data that are difficult for analysts
to interpret in real-time. 
This project proposes an Intelligent SSH Honeypot that automates the analysis of attacker behavior.
By integrating the Cowrie honeypot with a Large Language Model (LLM) analysis engine, the system captures attacker commands and uses Generative AI to interpret their intent, classify them based on MITRE ATT&CK categories, and visualize threats on a real-time dashboard.
This approach reduces the manual burden on security analysts by converting raw logs into actionable intelligence.
